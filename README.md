In today's era of data explosion, we are constantly receiving huge amounts of data such as text, images, videos and links.The generation of information is so fast and complex that the types, sizes, and dimensions of the data are far beyond the reach of traditional manual processing.Therefore, cluster analysis, as one of the most common unsupervised learning techniques, has been widely used in processing network big data, classifying and analyzing data patterns, and summarizing information knowledge.On the basis of an in-depth study of existing algorithm, this project for the present most of the traditional clustering algorithm applies only to deal with single view many data in the data, and the reality are describe problem by multiple angles at the same time, the introduction of multiple points of view, study a multi-view discriminant analysis method to dimension data, more than the original space perspective projection data sets to low dimensional space, fully considering the perspectives of both the diversified information, and reduce the complexity of data analysis.At the same time, in view of the disadvantages of high time complexity in most existing clustering algorithm tools, this paper tries to introduce an innovative single-angle clustering algorithm and describe the clustering center with a new idea.Taking the above two optimization objectives into consideration, the initial label information was obtained on the multi-angle data, and the new data set in the subspace was obtained after dimensionality reduction of the data, and the new clustering algorithm was used in the subspace to output the final classification label after several iterations, so as to establish a complete clustering algorithm model logically.Then experiments were carried out on two multi-perspective data sets, Image segmentation data set and Mfeat, to test the clustering results, and the clustering model was comprehensively evaluated based on three evaluation indexes.
